## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
write a new function called tree intersection that that takes two tree as arrguments

check if both trees have nodes inside them

define a 2 list and store the values of the trees nodes in them

define another list and store the values which are in both lists

return list

## Solution
