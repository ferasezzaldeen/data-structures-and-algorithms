# Trees
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
its a data structure that can have more then one child after it and link between them using edges 


## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I used the recursion function to make the requierd methods 

here is the [code](./trees.py)

here is the [tests](./trees_test.py)

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your trees -->
define 3 classes 
node: to make new nodes
binary_tree: to return the values inside the
binary_tree_search: to add new nodes and to now if a value is in the tree
