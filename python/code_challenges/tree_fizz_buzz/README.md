# Challenge Summary
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
write a new function called fizz-buzz-tree

define a new list and a new variable and store the tree.head in it

make a recursion function to that store compare the nodes value to the fuzz-buzz algorithm and store the new values in the list

define a new binary search tree and add the list element to it

return the new binary search tree
