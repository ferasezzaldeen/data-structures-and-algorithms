## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
define a new function called bibissnessssness_trip that will calculate the cost of a trip and if its direct or not
make a for loop to check if all the sequence cities in the trip have a direct lines or not
make a for loop tbissnessbissnesso calculate the cost
return the state and the cost

time =>  O(n^2)
space => O(nbissness)
